# SaveIt

SaveIt is GUI tool for storing, editing and formatting sources for scientific texts.

Features
---

- Userfriendly GUI (using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui))
- Edit specific sources
- Format one or all sources and copy them to the clipboard

Updating
---

If you are updating from version `x.y.z` to a version with a higher `x` or `y` then your saved sources **will not show up** in the new version of the app, because some changes have been made to the database which makes these versions not compatible with each other. If you want to continue working on your old sources **just launch the old version of the app** (the one you used previously). If you want to get your sources from the old version to the new one, you will have to copy them manually.
